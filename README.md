# Ultimate markdown to HTML!
## Short description
Node.js program which does only one simple thing: converts markdown file to html (or esc codes).
## How to launch
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Node.js (if you haven't already)
3. Open project folder in console, so you can directly call files inside it (or just open a terminal and use full path)
4. Run `npm install` (forgot to mension in last lab)
5. Run `node app.js <path to input file>` (this is not setup, this is app launch itself)
(Also use `node app.js -h` for help)
## Project usage
- `node app.js <file>` - converts given file and writes result to console
- `node app.js -o <output file> <file>` - same, but writes to given file instead
- `node app.js -format=esc <file>` - uses esc codes instead of html (can be combined with o)
## How to run tests
- `npm test` in the project with installed deps. - that's all.
## User instruction

## Conclusions
Since I mostly work with unity tests implementation is hard for me, because i don't need ball to move with specified speed, no, i need ball to be realistic. Maybe this is incorrect approach but it is what it is. But in some cases (like check some function in unity or writing program not for this engine, but maybe smth. for math or backend) it will be usefull.
