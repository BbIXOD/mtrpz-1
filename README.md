# Ultimate markdown to HTML!
## Short description
Node.js program which does only one simple thing: converts markdown file to html.
## How to launch
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Node.js (if you haven't already)
3. Open project folder in console, so you can directly call files inside it (or just open a terminal and use full path)
4. Run `node app.js <path to input file>`
(Also use `node app.js -h` for help)
## Project usage
- `node app.js <file>` - converts given file and writes result to console
- `node app.js <file> -o <output file>` - same, but writes to given file instead
